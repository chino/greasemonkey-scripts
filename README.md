greasemonkey-scripts
====================

Greasemonkey scripts I use for Firefox and Chrome.

Note: Chrome doesn't support @require hence I chose so far to use straight js even though there is ways around it.


# Update

Chrome has begun to require the use of chrome store to install extensions for security:

There is some work arounds:

- Easy and quick app developer tool lets you enable/add any app/extension you want: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/chrome-apps-extensions-de/ohmmkhmmmpcnpikjeljgnaoabkaalbgc/details
- Bunch of options here: http://superuser.com/questions/767286/re-enable-extensions-not-coming-from-chrome-web-store-on-chrome-v35-with-enhan/768154#768154
